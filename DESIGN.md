# Design Overview

This repository hosts both the MindQuantum website (Astro) and the documentation portal (Jupyter Book) to ensure a cohesive, maintainable user experience.

## Goals

- Single deployment to GitHub Pages for site + docs
- Consistent branding via shared design tokens
- Clear separation of concerns for easier maintenance
- Ability to source tutorials from MindSpore docs without a hard dependency

## Architecture

- Astro site at repo root. Static output in `dist/`.
- Two Jupyter Book projects in `docs/en` and `docs/zh`. Build outputs are centralized under `docs/_build/books/{lang}` and copied to `public/docs/{lang}`, which Astro serves at `/docs/{lang}/`.
- API (Sphinx) builds as two projects in `docs/api-en` and `docs/api-zh`. Outputs are centralized under `docs/_build/api/{lang}` and copied to `public/docs/api/{lang}`.
- GitHub Actions builds docs (Jupyter Book + Sphinx) first, then Astro, and deploys the combined `dist/`.

## i18n & Routing

- Default language is English (`en`); the root (`/`) renders English content.
- Non-default languages use a path prefix (e.g., `/zh/` for the Chinese homepage).
- Docs and API landing routes are language-aware via lightweight redirect pages:
  - `src/pages/docs/[lang]/index.astro` resolves a language-specific start page using `src/config/i18n.ts`.
  - `src/pages/api/[lang]/index.astro` forwards to the respective API index.
- Home content strings live in `src/locales/home.ts` to keep copy centralized and typed.
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` accepts a `lang` prop, setting the document `lang` attribute correctly for accessibility and SEO.
- A header link exposes the Chinese homepage at `/zh/` for discoverability.

## Theming Strategy

- Shared CSS variables in `src/styles/tokens.css` model brand color, typography, and spacing.
- Build step (`scripts/prepare-tokens.mjs`) syncs tokens into `docs/_static/mq-variables.css` so Jupyter Book can use the same variables.
- `docs/_static/mq-theme.css` applies light overrides on top of `sphinx_book_theme` to reflect the brand without forking the upstream theme.

This approach avoids maintaining a heavy bespoke Sphinx theme while still achieving visual parity and keeping upgrade paths simple.

## Content Sourcing

- The build does not depend on external repositories.
- Tutorials: `scripts/sync_mindquantum_from_msdocs.py` copies MindQuantum tutorial sources from a local `mindspore/docs` clone (`docs/mindquantum/docs/source_en` and `source_zh_cn`) into `docs/en/src` and `docs/zh/src`.
- API: `scripts/sync_mindquantum_api.py` copies API `.rst` sources from a local `mindquantum` clone (`docs/api_python_en` and `docs/api_python`) into the language-specific `src/` folders.

## Deployment

- GitHub Actions computes the correct `ASTRO_BASE` for project pages (e.g., `/mq-website/`) and sets it during the Astro build.
- Artifacts from both builders are uploaded together for a single Pages deployment.

## Future Enhancements

- Add dedicated API reference via Sphinx autodoc in `docs/` and expose under `/docs/api/`.
- Add a global language switcher that maps current routes across locales (e.g., `/docs/en/...` â†” `/docs/zh/...`).
- Add versioned docs (e.g., by building multiple books into `public/docs/vX/`).
- Replace the simple CSS stack with Tailwind + PostCSS in Astro if desired; tokens remain the source of truth.
